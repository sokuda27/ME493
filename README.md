Description:
This independent study provides an introduction to state-of-the-art methods employed in the field of data-driven engineering. Data-driven methods such as the proper orthogonal decomposition and the dynamic mode decomposition are used in a variety of fields including fluid dynamics, climate analysis, mixing problems, the study of infectious diseases, etc. Data-driven methods rely heavily on concepts from linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics. We will review these essential elements and develop a hands-on understanding of a selection of data-driven methods. The study culminates with an application of some method(s) to a practical problem which is to be carefully detailed in a technical report.
